Every investor faces a fundamental choice: equity or debt? Understanding the difference between these two asset classes is the first step toward building a balanced portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

### What is Equity?

Equity investing means buying ownership (shares) in a company. The goal is to generate returns through capital appreciation (the stock price going up) and dividends.

- **Pros:** High potential for long-term growth.
- **Cons:** Higher risk and market volatility.

### What is Debt?

Debt investing involves lending money to an entity (like a government or corporation) in exchange for regular interest payments and the return of the principal amount at maturity. Examples include bonds and fixed deposits.

- **Pros:** Lower risk and predictable, stable returns.
- **Cons:** Lower potential for high growth compared to equities.
