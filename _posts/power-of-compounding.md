Albert Einstein reportedly called compounding the "eighth wonder of the world." It's a simple concept that can have a massive impact on your wealth, especially when you start investing early.

### How Does Compounding Work?

Compounding is the process where the returns you earn on your investment start to generate their own returns. It's essentially "interest on your interest."

For example, if you invest ₹10,000 and earn 10% interest in the first year, you'll have ₹11,000. In the second year, you'll earn 10% on the entire ₹11,000, not just the original ₹10,000. This creates a snowball effect that grows your wealth exponentially over time.

### The Key is Time

The longer your money stays invested, the more powerful compounding becomes. That's why financial advisors always stress the importance of starting your investment journey as early as possible, even with small amounts.
